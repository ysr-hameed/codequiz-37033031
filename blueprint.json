  "stackReasoning": "Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a lightweight and easily deployable solution. This is suitable since there's no need for a complex backend framework. For a simple quiz application that primarily relies on front-end logic and static data. It is accessible and requires no extra setup. This approach allows us to focus on the core quiz functionality and user interface without the overhead of a more complex stack. This tech stack is perfect for creating static web pages with interactive elements.",
